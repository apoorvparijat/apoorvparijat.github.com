## Accurate and Instant Rank Tracking - RankDemon.com

Hello,

I've been working on a rank tracking tool for couple 
of months now. There are more than enough tools out
there which track rankings. And they all do a pretty
good job but there are two areas where they fall short.

1. Amount of time they take to fetch rankings 
2. Multiple steps involved in adding a domain for tracking - bad experience

With RankDemon.com, I've tried to address both of the
above issues. The checking process starts just as you press
enter and you're shown real time progress feedback. 

From the user's review so far, my solution seems to be close.

Here's one user review - 
---------------------------------------
"I think the first thing that impressed me was the speed of the 
site. I've used some similar type services in the past--by 
comparison RankDemon had a really snappy interface. But even 
better, as soon as I entered a site and keyword, I was shown 
the current ranking.

I entered some info where I knew the current ranking and 
RankDemon came back with the same numbers.

You can categorize your sites into projects which can be 
helpful if you have several different sites.

I really like the layout of the screen where you have sites 
and keywords listed in table form on the left, and a graph of 
your ranking over time on the right.

I'm very impressed so far, and the prices are better than 
other services I've used in the past."
---------------------------------------

Few features (Alexa, Bing stats) are still on their way
but the basics are in place.

Do let me know your feedback on the new tool. Any feedback
is priceless and more than welcome.
